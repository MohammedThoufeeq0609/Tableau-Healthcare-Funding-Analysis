# Tableau Healthcare Research Funding Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project features an extensive, interactive dashboard built using **Tableau Desktop** to analyze **Global Healthcare Funding** trends between 2008 and 2024. The analysis uses a comprehensive dataset that includes funding amounts, specific research/disease areas, and supplementary 2019 US mortality and prevalence data.

The goal was to provide a visual and analytical foundation for stakeholders to understand **resource allocation**, identify **key funding gaps**, and explore the **relationship between funding and health outcomes**.

## Key Analytical Objectives

The dashboard was designed to answer the following core questions:

1.  **Funding Trends:** Analyze the year-over-year evolution of total healthcare research funding.
2.  **Resource Allocation:** Compare funding levels across different **research/disease areas** (e.g., Clinical Research, Immunization, Chronic Diseases).
3.  **Outcome Correlation:** Investigate the relationship (if any) between research funding and key public health metrics like **US mortality and disease prevalence**.
4.  **Distribution:** Identify which disease areas receive the largest and smallest average funding amounts.

## Technologies & Methodologies

* **Primary Tool:** **Tableau Desktop** for data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **Data Preparation:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and structuring were performed before import to ensure a high-quality data model in Tableau.
* **Visualizations Used:**
    * **Line Graphs:** To show **funding trends** over time (2008-2024).
    * **Bar/Doughnut/Tree Maps:** To compare funding allocation by research area.
    * **Scatter Plots:** To explore the **correlation** between funding and US mortality/prevalence rates.
    * **Whisker Charts:** Used for comparing distribution and central tendency of funds across categories.

## Key Insights Delivered

The analysis and visualizations revealed several important findings:

* **Funding Growth:** The total research funding demonstrated a **consistent upward trend** over the 16-year period, although growth rates varied significantly by year.
* **Top Funded Areas:** **Clinical Research** consistently received the largest share of funding, highlighting its central role in the healthcare R&D ecosystem.
* **Funding Gaps:** The analysis pinpointed certain disease areas that, despite high US prevalence or mortality rates, appeared to be **under-represented** in terms of average funding.
* **Correlation:** The scatter plots provided visual evidence to discuss whether funding directly correlates with a reduction in mortality rates, offering a basis for further research and resource prioritization.
